[The Tools of a Blind Programmer](https://www.parhamdoustdar.com/2016/04/03/tools-of-blind-programmer/)

<p> I find this article interesting because this shows how the methods one person uses to develop software may work for them but not for others. Each individual has to find the environment, setup and tools that work for them. Specifically, there are tools for people to help visualize their work process and flow of thought that can be more helpful to certain people than others. There is no absoulute correct aproach to development, and software engineering/ development is a form of creativity in itself. There are so many options and many tools out there to help people make software development an easier process. Finding the right tools that work for you and understanding them can be a challenge at first, but these tools are crucial to the development of your software. </p>

I think this is a really awesome article!! Not just because its about accessibility issues tht are physical but because it even hints on accessibility based on location, like the author needing pirated copies of IDEs because they're in Iran. I also prefer Eclipse so it was nice to see they have some focus on being more accessible, especially because diversity is key in much coding and even crucial in some areas.
